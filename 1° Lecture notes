# FRED data is the most influential source of macroeconomic data. Prices are computed monthly. Seasonally adjusted means that,  
for example, we want to remove the deviation of Christmas shopping (inflation) or August less shopping (deflation).

# On FRED data we can modify data, for example: modify the frequency (we could see the monthly inflation rate, 
so compared to the previous month).

# FRED-MD is a monthly database (https://research.stlouisfed.org/wp/more/2015-012). In this paper, that we are supposed to be  
able to replicate (https://s3.amazonaws.com/real.stlouisfed.org/wp/2015/2015-012.pdf), at page 28 we can see in the  
table the FRED mnemonic column and also the universal GSI mnemonic.

# FRED data is the most influential source of macroeconomic data. Prices are computed monthly. Seasonally adjusted means that,  
for example, we want to remove the deviation of Christmas shopping (inflation) or August less shopping (deflation).

# On FRED data we can modify data, for example: modify the frequency (we could see the monthly inflation rate, 
so compared to the previous month).

# FRED-MD is a monthly database (https://research.stlouisfed.org/wp/more/2015-012). In this paper, that we are supposed to be  
able to replicate (https://s3.amazonaws.com/real.stlouisfed.org/wp/2015/2015-012.pdf), at page 28 we can see in the  
table the FRED mnemonic column and also the universal GSI mnemonic.

# The flash estimate of inflation is made every month (usually the 10th day in EURO area) and then it's revised with more precision.

# Forecasting is: given the information available today, I want to create a model to predict the future values.

# ALFRED is an archive of the "vintage" versions of data that were available in certaind dates. This is useful because  
data are always revised and updated with more precision, so without ALFRED it might be impossible to retrieve the actual data  
produced in the past.
